Compatibility
---
While rare, sometimes Steamworks SDK updates will break compatilibity with older GodotSteam versions. Any compatability breaks are noted below. API files (dll, so, dylib) _should_ still work for older version.

Steamworks SDK Version | GodotSteam Version
---|---
1.59 or newer | 4.2 or newer
1.58a or older | 4.1 or older

Versions of GodotSteam that have compatibility breaks introduced.

GodotSteam Version | Broken Compatibility
---|---
4.3| Networking identity system removed, replaced with Steam IDs

Known Issues
---
- GDExtension for 4.1 is **not** compatible with 4.0.3 or lower. Please check the versions you are using.
- Steam overlay will not work when running your game from the editor if you are using Forward+ as the renderer.  It does work with Compatibility though.  Your exported project will work perfectly fine in the Steam client, however.
- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strongly recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.

"Quick" How-To
---
For complete instructions on how to build the GDExtension version of GodotSteam Server from scratch, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To Modules' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/gdextension/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/CoaguCo-Industries/GodotSteam-Server/releases) or [from the Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2218) and skip compiling it yourself!

Usage
----------
Do not use the GDExtension version of GodotSteam Server with any of the module versions whether it be our pre-compiled versions or ones you compile.  They are not compatible with each other.

When exporting with the GDExtension version, please use the normal Godot Engine templates instead of our GodotSteam Server templates or you will have a lot of issues.
